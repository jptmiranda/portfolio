  <p>
    Hello, I'm a full-stack developer with nearly three years of experience
    specializing in web solutions. My journey in the web development world has
    led me to work on a diverse range of projects, from maintaining and
    revamping company websites to developing backoffice applications and tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    A highlight in my career has been integrating bank APIs to facilitate home
    loan credit simulations. These integrations have provided users with
    insights to make informed financial decisions without making a single
    transaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    Always eager to explore, one of my main sources of motivation is the
    exploration of new technologies, so I am constantly searching for next new
    thing in the digital world. I also have some experience in DevOps since I am
    always looking to improve CI/CD flows on the projects I work on.
