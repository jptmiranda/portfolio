      Hello, I'm a full-stack developer with nearly three years of experience
      specializing in web solutions. My journey in the web development world has
      led me to work on a diverse range of projects, from maintaining and
      revamping company websites to developing backoffice applications and
      tools.
    </p>

    <p class="leading-relaxed">
      A highlight in my career has been integrating bank APIs to facilitate home
      loan credit simulations. These integrations have provided users with
      insights to make informed financial decisions without making a single
      transaction.
    </p>

    <p class="leading-relaxed">
      Always eager to explore, one of my main sources of motivation is the
      exploration of new technologies, so I am constantly searching for next new
      thing in the digital world. I also have some experience in DevOps since I
      am always looking to improve CI/CD flows on the projects I work on.
